"""Baby Names exercise

Implement the babyname parser class that parses the popular names and their ranks from an html file.

1) First, you need to implement a decorator that checks whether the html file exists or not.
2) Also, the parser should extract tuples of (rank, male-name, female-name) from the html file by using regex.
   When writing regex, it's convenient to include a copy of the target text for reference.
3) Finally, you need to implement `parse` method in `BabynameParser` class that parses the extracted tuples
   with the given lambda and returns a list of processed results.
